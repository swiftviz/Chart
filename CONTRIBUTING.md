# Contributing

We welcome contributions and collaborators!

If you’d like to contribute:

1. File a ticket describing the bug you want to fix or feature you want to add. Or find an existing ticket.
2. Bring it up in the [discussions section](http://github.com/swiftviz/Chart/discussions) (which may or may not include implementation discussion). **This is very important, because there might be things you need to know before you start work.**
3. Once approved, then go for it. Write the code, then do a pull request. We’ll either have comments or we’ll merge it. (We might revise it afterward, of course.)

## Pull Requests

Pull requests must merge cleanly with the git branch `main`. If they don't, we'll ask you to resovle any conflicts before merging it.

The code must compile and all tests must pass before the pull request is ready to merge.

## Guidelines

Read through the [coding guidelines](technotes/CodingGuidelines.md) first.
If your code doesn’t follow the guidelines, we will likely suggest revising it.

Patience may be required at times.

Our code of conduct is below.
